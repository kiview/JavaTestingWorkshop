Create a simple String calculator with a method signature:
int add(String numbers)
The method can take up to two numbers, separated by commas, and will return their sum. E.g., “” or “1” or “1,2”
as inputs (for an empty string it will return 0) .
Hints:
Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to one and two numbers
Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to write tests you did not think about
Remember to refactor after each passing test


Support different delimiters
To change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: “//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]”
E.g., “//;\n1;2” should return three where the default delimiter is ‘;’ .
The first line is optional. All existing scenarios should still be supported



Add a logging Interface (Logger.write())
Add logging abilities to your String Calculator (you will need a mock).
Every time you call add(), the sum result will be logged to the logger.

When calling add() and the logger throws an exception, the calculator should notify an Webservice of some kind,
that logging has failed with the message from the logger’s exception (you will need a mock and a stub).
